// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the process that involves communication with product users to define their expectations, resolve conflicts, and document all the key requirements."
const design = "This is the process of envisioning and defining software solutions and transforming user requirements into some suitable form, which helps the programmer in software coding and implementation."
const implementation = "This is the stage of coding the software. Developers build the entire system by writing code using the programming languages."
const testingAndIntegration = "This is a stage where the different conponents of a software undergo testing as combined entity to ensure that it meets all the functional requirements and to expose defects in the interaction between software components when they are integrated."
const maintain = "This is the process of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with customer needs. Is it performed to improve the software overall, correct any issues or bugs after the product is launched."
